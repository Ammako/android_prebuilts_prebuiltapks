# Prebuilt APKs

This is a collection of FOSS APKs, coupled with their respective Android.mk for easy integration into the Android build system.

These are the official unmodified prebuilt binaries, signed by their corresponding developers, except for com.google.android.maps; the JAR and the XML have been extracted from the ZIP on the [microG's GitHub release page](https://github.com/microg/android_frameworks_mapsv1/releases).

To include them in your build, just add their name to `CUSTOM_PACKAGES`.

The included APKs are:
 * F-Droid packages (binaries sourced from [here](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid/) and [here](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged/))
